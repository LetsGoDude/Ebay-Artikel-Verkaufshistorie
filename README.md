## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Where does the data come from?**

- ebay. This add-on only links to the correct page for the product you are looking at, all functions and data are from ebay.

**The button is no longer there, although I have installed the add-on**

- The button is loaded dynamically, which means that if ebay significantly changes the layout of its site, the button may appear in the wrong place or not at all. In this case, simply open a issue.
